decaux
======

Minimalist framework to enforce some of the structures of a C-like language.

This project was created for a very particular unusual use-case, so is unlikely to see significant development.

Mapped Functions
----------------

Currently, only the following functions are mapped to `global`:

* `include`
* `sprintf`

Installation
------------

Install globally via npm:

`npm install -g decaux`

Then you can execute scripts via the command line:

`decaux main.js`

Examples
--------

See the `test` folder for an example script.
